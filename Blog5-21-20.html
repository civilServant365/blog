    <tr>
      <td>  Cell division and lack of
        differentiation work well for the hydra.
        It causes it's cells to stay young and
        vibrant keeping the plant healthy. Hydras live underwater and
        are therefore able to hydrate excessively.
        The hypothesis postulated by
        Mcintyre states
        cellular hydration causes cell division
        and lack of differentiation and that
        results in cancer in humans. Cellular hydration is
        different than drinking water. Cellular hydration occurs for many reasons
        including inflammation and medicine reactions. Drinking water affects
        cellular hydration too. Do hydra's
        get cancer? Yes they do. If hydration prevents apoptosis
        could human cells flake off like those of
        the hydra? Mcintyres theory about cancer
        is interesting. Cancer is a major biomarker
         of aging. If his theory about microwaves
         and cancer treatment were true it
        would be a major breakthrough. What if he
         was onto something bigger? Could humans
          lack senscence with proper hydration and
           cell flaking or microwave treatment for
            cancer? People who drink 1-2 hundred oz of water each day
            have healthy looking skin. What happens to the rest of their body? It seems
            it is healthy too because hydrated cells are able to absorb more nutrients.
            Perhaps if Mcintyre is right about cancer treatment simply drinking water could be the
            fountain of youth. I'm excited about my nutrition course at college this summer.</td>
